# This leaves just the slipcover json data.  We could convert it to
# coverage.py format but coverage.py format is a SQLite database with an
# unstable schema.  There are no tools for merging slipcover json data so it
# wouldn't help to get the coverage.py data into slipcover json format either.
# Neither tool's native format helps so let's consider third-party formats.
# lcov can merge reports and coverage.py can emit lcov data.  If we can
# convert slipcover json to lcov then we can merge that way.

# What about reporting though?  codecov.io supports lcov.  coveralls.io might
# through a third-party tool but it's not completely clear.  We can also just
# locally emit reports using lcov itself.  This gives an okay summary of
# coverage from this data but is no help in reporting on coverage changes.
#
# So maybe we use codecov.io and just send the lcov there.
